# DySan


This repository gathers the ressources (i.e., datasets and source codes) associated to the paper DYSAN: Dynamically sanitizing motion sensor data against sensitive inferences through adversarial networks submitted to ICML 2020. More precisely, we list the different datasets used in our evaluations and present a short guide to reproduce results. We also explain how to use our implementation of the comparative baselines we consider to assess the performance of DySan.


## Datasets


### MotionSense
The MotionSense dataset and a description of the data are publicly available: https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/motion-sense
The raw data is shaped thanks to the code available in the github of MotionSense
The data used is available in "data" directory of the current repository.


### MobiAct
The MobiAct dataset is publicly available: https://bmi.hmu.gr/the-mobifall-and-mobiact-datasets-2/
